`teal.slice` is an `R` library used in the development of `teal` `shiny`
modules. It provides:

- a class accepting an array of `data.frames` as an input, then
  supporting basic `dplyr` operations on the data,
- a method returning the code needed to slice the data in the desired
  way,
- a set of `shiny` modules helping to acquire the desired slice of data
  using a `shiny` `GUI`.

## Installation

``` r
install.packages('teal.slice')
```

Alternatively, you might want to use the development version.

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("insightsengineering/teal.slice")
```

## Usage

To understand how to use this package, please refer to the [Introduction
to
`teal.slice`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.slice/latest-tag/articles/teal-slice.html)
article, which provides multiple examples of code implementation.
