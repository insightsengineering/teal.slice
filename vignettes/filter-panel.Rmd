NOTE - the text and diagrams in this vignette are slightly out of date and will be updated shortly.

The key changes not yet incorporated:
1) There is no longer a `CDISCFilteredDataset` object all data.frame are `DefaultFilteredDataset` now.
2) `FilteredDataset` no longer contains reactive data this is stored inside `FilteredData` instead.
3) It is also possible to create a `FilteredData` object directly from a list of data.frames without
create a `TealData` object see `help(init_filtered_data)` for more details.
4) `FilteredData$private$keys` is now a `JoinKeys` object instead of a nested list.  

## Overview

Filter panel is located in the right side of the teal apps and is responsible for filtering data
globally for the whole application. Filter panel is entirely encapsulated within `FilteredData` class,
which manages filter states, data filtering and reproducible filter code. Filter panel is composed
of several classes but `FilteredData` is the only class which the app developer will face directly.
`FilteredData` is accessible in teal modules as a `dataset` argument.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/filter_panel/filter_panel_uml_all.jpg")
```

`FilteredData` contains one-to-many `FilteredDataset` objects which contain `TealDataset` passed from
`TealData` after all datasets are loaded. While `FilteredData` manages whole filter panel,
`FilteredDataset` is responsible for single dataset filtering. Depending on a variant of
`FilteredDataset` it can contain one or many `FilterStates`. `FilterStates` class object has one or
two `ReactiveQueue` where `FilterState` objects are stored. `FilterState` is a single filter applied
to one variable/column while `FilterStates` is a collection of filters combined within single filter
call.

## Initialization

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/filter_panel/filtered_data_init.jpg")
```

`FilteredData` is initialized in `srv_teal` when `TealData$is_pulled()` returns `TRUE`.
`FilteredData` is dispatched on type of `TealData`, and if DDL is `CDISCTealData` then
`CDISCFilteredData` is initialized. Each `TealDataset` from `CDISCTealData` determines the type of the
`FilteredDataset`. In the above diagram `CDISCTealDataset` initializes `CDISCFilteredDataset` and
`MAETealDataset` initializes `MAEFilteredDataset`.
The most complicated concept in the new filter panel is `FilterStates`, which are initialized in
`FilteredDataset`. The type and number of `FilterStates` depends on the data kept in the
`FilteredDataset`. You can imagine `FilterStates` as one `subset` call. The case of
`data.frame` (`DFFilteredDataset`) is simple, because we know that single `dplyr::filter` call
is sufficient to subset data rows. Consider `MultiAssayExperiment` object which contains patients
data in `@colData` and multiple experiments in `@ExperimentList`. Because `MultiAssayExperiment`
contains multiple objects and each must be filtered by a separate call, this is why multiple
`FilterStates` objects are required for `MAEFilteredDataset`. `ReactiveQueue` are created within
`FilterStates` and their number also depends on the `FilterStates` type.
Described objects are created instantly when data is loaded and they remain unchanged, whereas
`FilterState` is initialized each time when the new filter is added. Values of the `FilterState` can
change and also it can be removed and added once again.

## Classes description

This section describes in detail each class managing filter panel.

### `FilteredData`

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/filter_panel/class_details_filtered_data.jpg")
```

`FilteredData` is exposed to the apps/modules developer as a `dataset` argument in the modules.
`FilteredData` manages filter panel by returning filtered data, combining reproducible filter calls
from `FilteredDatasets`. `FilteredData` also contains all shiny modules displayed on the right panel
in teal apps. `FilteredData` is a single object which is initialized in `srv_teal` module and its
variant depends on `TealData`. If DDL returns `CDISCTealData` then `CDISCFilteredData` is
initialized, otherwise `FilteredData`.

In the analytical modules `datasets` can be used to:

- obtain filtered and unfiltered data using `datasets$get_data(<dataname>, filtered = <TRUE/FALSE>)`.
- get available datanames using `datasets$datanames()`
- get reproducible filter call using `datasets$get_call(<dataname>)`
- get reproducible data loading call `datasets$get_code(<dataname>)`
- get `JoinKeys` between two datasets using `datasets$get_join_keys(<dataname1>, <dataname2>)`
- get variable labels using `datasets$get_varlabels(<dataname>)`
- get parent dataset name using `datasets$get_parentname(<dataname>)` (only in case of
  `CDISCFilteredData`)

### `FilteredDataset`

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/filter_panel/class_details_filtered_dataset.jpg")
```

`FilteredDataset` is a class which keeps unfiltered data and returns filtered data based on the
filter call derived from `FilterStates`.
`FilteredDataset` class objects are initialized by `FilteredData`, one for each `TealDataset`.
`FilteredDataset` contains single `TealDataset` object and one-to-many `FilterStates` depending on the
type of object. `FilteredDataset` stores dataset attributes, joins keys to other datasets, and also
combines and executes the code taken from `FilterStates`.

Following `FilteredDataset` derived classes are already implemented:

- `DefaultFilteredDataset` dispatched by `TealDataset` to manage filters for `data.frame` object.
- `CDISCFilteredDataset` dispatched by `CDISCTealDataset` to manage filters for `data.frame` matching
  ADAM standards.
- `MAEFilteredDataset` dispatched by `MAETealDataset` to manage filters for `MultiAssayExperiment`
  object.

### `FilterStates`

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/filter_panel/class_details_filter_states.jpg")
```

`FilterStates` are initialized by the `FilteredDataset` when teal app starts. The type and number of
`FilterStates` depends on the type of data included in `TealDataset`. If data in `FilteredDataset`
is composed of multiple objects then the equivalent number of `FilterStates` is initialized. One
`FilterStates` object is responsible to make one subset call.
Consider the case of `MultiAssayExperiment` object which contains multiple experiments and patients data
stored in separate slots. Each of the objects within `MultiAssayExperiment` can be filtered by
separate calls. Each sub-element in `TealDataset` needs also separate inputs to select subset variables,
which then should be applied to the same sub-element of the `TealDataset`.

Currently following variants are possible:

- `DFFilterStates` dispatched by `data.frame`, uses `data.frame` columns for filtering.
- `MAEFilterStates` dispatched by `MultiAssayExperiment`, uses columns of object kept in `@colData`
  slot for filtering.
- `SEFilterStates` dispatched by `SummarizedExperiment`, uses columns of objects kept in `@colData`
  and `@rowData` for filtering.
- `MatrixFilterStates` dispatched by `matrix`, uses `matrix` columns for filtering.

`FilterStates` serves two Shiny related purposes:

- `ui/srv_add_filter_state` allow to add `FilterState` for selected variable. Variables included
  in the module are the filterable colnames of the provided dataset. Variable selection adds `FilterState` to
  `ReactiveQueue` (stored in list `private$queue[[queue_id]]`). `FilterState` is dispatched
  automatically on a selected column class.

### `FilterState`

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/filter_panel/class_details_filter_state.jpg")
```

This class controls single filter card and returns condition call depending on what is selected.
`FilterState` is initialized each time when a user selects filter variable in
`FilterState$add_filter_variable` module. `FilterState` is dispatched based on the type of the selected variable.
Depending on the type of the filter state, there are different UI inputs - for example only numeric has
`use_inf` checkbox button.
`private$selected`, `private$use_na`, `private$use_inf` are reactive values and they trigger
re-execution of `FilterState$get_call` whenever their values change.
The constructor of `FilterState` has `extract_type` argument which impacts returned call. `extract_type`
can be unspecified, `"matrix"` or `"list"` and its value corresponds to the type of the variable prefix
in the returned condition call. For example if `FilterState` is initialized with
`extract_type = "matrix"` then the variable in the condition call looks like
`<input_dataname>[, "<varname>"]`.

## Making reproducible filter call

### Overview

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/filter_panel/get_call_overview.jpg")
```

Above diagram presents the filter panel classes and their responsibilities when composing filter calls.

- `FilterState$get_call()` returns a single condition call based on single variable
- `ReactiveQueue` is a container which stores multiple condition calls. `ReactiveQueue` objects are
  kept in a list where the names of elements are set after the argument names.
- `FilterStates$get_call()` returns a single filter call by gathering conditions returned from `FilterState` and
  combining them by `&` operator grouped by argument name.
- `FilteredDataset$get_call()` returns the list of calls taken from `FilterStates` object(s).
- `FilteredData$get_call(<dataname>)` returns the list of calls from specified `FilteredDataset`.

### Example

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/filter_panel/get_call_example.jpg")
```

Calling `datasets$get_call(<dataname>)` in teal modules executes a chain of calls in all filter panel
classes. Consider a scenario in which:

(1) `FilteredData` has three `FilteredDataset`(s) ADSL , ADTTE, MAE

(2) `CDISCFilteredDataset` contains `data.frame` (ADSL) which can be filtered only in one way
executing single `dplyr::filter` call (this is why `CDISCFilteredDataset` has a single `FilterStates`)

(3) `FilterStates` construct `dplyr::filter` call is based on the `FilterState` objects added to the
`ReactiveQueue`.

(4) `ReactiveQueue` is just a class to manage addition, storage and removal of `FilterStates`
objects. This is its only responsibility and the class does not generate any code. `DFFilterState`
contains only one `ReactiveQueue` which is not named - this tells `FilterState` that calls from each
`FilterState` should go to unnamed argument in `dplyr::filter`.

(5) When the end-user chooses some variable in "Add Filter Variable" section, then new `FilterState` is
added to the `ReactiveQueue` and this new condition is added to `dplyr::filter(ADSL, ...)` call.
In the example `SEX` and `AGE` has been added - which are automatically dispatched to relevant
`FilterState` class (`ChoiceFilterState` and `RangeFilterState`).
Since (5) have been added or changed, conditions (`SEX == "F"` and `AGE >= 20 & AGE <= 60`) are
returned to the `DFFilterStates` (3) which combines them with `&` operator and puts to
`dplyr::filter` call. `CDISCFilteredDataset` takes this one call and return to `FilteredData` as a
list.

(6) Second `FilteredDataset` for `ADTTE` works the same way as `ADSL` with one difference.
`dplyr::filter` for `ADTTE` is followed by the merge call with `FILTERED_ADSL` - to be filtered by
keys available parent.

(7) `FilteredDatasetMAE` is based on `MAETealDataset` where `raw_data` contains multiple objects which can
be filtered on. In general `MultiAssayExperiment` contains `colData(MAE)` which is a `DataFrame`
with ADSL-like patient data. `MAE` contains also multiple experiments which can be extracted using
`MAE[["experiment name"]]` and they can also be filtered in filter-panel. This means that
`FilteredDatasetMAE` has multiple `FilterStates` objects: one for subjects data and one for each
experiment.

(8) `MAEFilterStates` object is initialized for subjects data and for this object
`SummarizedExperiment::subsetByColData` function is applied. `SummarizedExperiment::subsetByColData`
has two arguments `x` (data) and `y` (conditions). `MAEFilterStates` similar to `DFFilterStates`
has one `ReactiveQueue` (9) list for `y` argument in the function. Adding new `FilterStates`
triggers returning of the code similar to (4) and (5)

(10) `SEFilterStates` is initialized per one experiment in the MAE data. This class is specific
because `SummarizedExperiment` contains `colData` and `rowData` which correspond to `select` and
`subset` arguments in `subset.SummarizedExperiment` function. Similar to `subset.data.frame`
`subset` refers to the rows in the object, and `select` refers to the columns - but the call
execution is little different because subsetting and selecting call refers to columns in `colData`
and `rowData` (objects attached to this experiment).

## Filter-panel API

All of filter-panel classes have dedicated methods to set and get current filter state.
These methods include:
- `get_filter_state`
- `set_filter_state`
- `remove_filter_state`
- `clear_filter_states`

Setting and getting filter-panel states are done through a nested list which follows a
specific pattern. The structure of the list should reflect the address of `FilterState`(s) object.
By default (`data.frame`), the structure will follow the pattern shown in the code below,
with a list element for each variable from each dataset. In case of `MultiAssayExperiment`
objects, the situation looks different, because these datasets have a multiple objects inside,
so the list needs to refer to the object one wants to set/get filter from.

```
dataset-1: #data.frame
  variable-1:
    selected: [<selected>]
    keep_na: <keep_na>
  ...

dataset-n: # MAE
  subjects:
    variable-1:
      selected: [<selected>]
      keep_na: <keep_na>
    ...
  experiment-1:
    subset:
      variable-1:
        selected: [<selected>]
        keep_na: <keep_na>
      ...
    select:
      variable-2:
        selected: [<selected>]
        keep_na: <keep_na>
      ...
  ...
```

The above list structure is applied in `get_filter_state`, `set_filter_state` and
`remove_filter_state`. In the example below, we present how these methods can be used.

1. Setting the filter state
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(teal.slice)

datasets <- init_filtered_data(
  list(
    iris = list(dataset = iris),
    mtcars = list(dataset = mtcars)
  )
)

set_filter_state(
  datasets = datasets,
  filter = list(
    iris = list(Species = list(selected = "virginica", keep_na = FALSE)),
    mtcars = list(mpg = list(selected = c(20.0, 25.0), keep_na = FALSE, keep_inf = FALSE))
  )
)
```

2. Getting the filter state
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
get_filter_state(datasets)
```

3. Removing filter states
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
remove_filter_state(
  datasets = datasets,
  filter = list(iris = c("Species"))
)
```

4. Updating filter states. *Works only in the shiny reactive context.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set_filter_state(
  datasets = datasets,
  filter = list(
    mtcars = list(mpg = list(selected = c(22.0, 25.0)))
  )
)
```

5. Clear the filter state
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
clear_filter_states(datasets)
```

The above code can be also used in the modules. In the example below filter-panel states
are changed when clicking the buttons in the encoding-panel.

```{r}
library(shiny)

datasets <- init_filtered_data(
  list(
    iris = list(dataset = iris),
    mtcars = list(dataset = mtcars)
  )
)

app <- shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    fluidRow(
      column(
        width = 9,
        id = "teal_primary_col",
        shiny::tagList(
          actionButton("add_species_filter", "Set iris$Species filter"),
          actionButton("remove_species_filter", "Remove iris$Species filter"),
          actionButton("remove_all_filters", "Remove all filters"),
          verbatimTextOutput("rcode"),
          verbatimTextOutput("filter_state")
        )
      ),
      column(
        width = 3,
        id = "teal_secondary_col",
        datasets$ui_filter_panel("filter_panel")
      )
    )
  ),
  server = function(input, output, session) {
    datasets$srv_filter_panel("filter_panel")
    output$filter_state <- renderPrint(get_filter_state(datasets))
    output$rcode <- renderText(
      paste(
        sapply(c("iris", "mtcars"), datasets$get_call),
        collapse = "\n"
      )
    )
    observeEvent(input$add_species_filter, {
      set_filter_state(
        datasets,
        list(iris = list(Species = list(selected = c("setosa", "versicolor"))))
      )
    })
    observeEvent(input$remove_species_filter, {
      states <- get_filter_state(datasets)
      if (!is.null(states$iris$Species)) {
        remove_filter_state(datasets, list(iris = "Species"))
      }
    })
    observeEvent(input$remove_all_filters, clear_filter_states(datasets))
  }
)
if (interactive()) {
  runApp(app)
}
```
