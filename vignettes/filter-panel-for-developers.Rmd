## Filter Panel API

### Getting and setting filter states

All filter panel classes have dedicated methods to set and get current filter state.
These methods include:

- `get_filter_state` - returns the current state of filters in form of `teal_slices` object
- `set_filter_state` - adds or modifies the filters based on `teal_slices` object
- `remove_filter_state` - removes particular filter states based on `teal_slices` object
- `clear_filter_states` - removes all filter states

Setting and getting filter states are done through `teal_slices` object which is a collection of `teal_slice` objects. 
Think of a `teal_slice` as a quantum of information that fully describes the filter state of one variable.

In order to tell `FilteredData` to set a filter for a specific variable, 
one must call the `set_filter_state` method with a `teal_slices` object containing a `teal_slice` 
that refers to the variable of interest.
To remove a particular `FilterState` object, one must call the `remove_filter_state` method 
using a `teal_slices` containing a `teal_slice` that refers to the respective variable.

Each `teal_slice` object contains all the information necessary to:

1. Determine the column in the data set on which to apply the filter expression:

   - `dataname` - name of the data set
   - `varname` - name of the column
   - `experiment` (only for `MultiAssayExperiment` objects) - name of the experiment
   - `arg` (only for `SummarizedExperiment` objects, e.g within a `MultiAssayExperiment`) - 
   name of the argument in the call to `subset` (`subset` of `select`)

2. Express or store the current selection state:

   - `selected` - selected values or limits of the selected range
   - `keep_inf` - determines if `Inf` values should be dropped
   - `keep_na` - determines if `NA` values should be dropped
   - `expr` - explicit logical expression

3. Control the behavior and appearance of the `FilterState` object:

   - `choices` - determines the set of values or the range that can be selected from
   - `multiple` (only for `ChoiceFilterState`) - allows multiple values to be selected 
   - `fixed` - forbids changing state of the `FilterState`
   - `anchored` - forbids removal of the `FilterState`
   - `title` - displayed title of the filter card

In addition, every `teal_slice` object has an `id`. 

It is impossible to create `FilteredData` with slices with duplicated `id`s.
This is because filter states are both created and modified with the `set_filter_state` method
so if two consecutive calls to `set_filter_state` are passed a `teal_slice` with the same id, 
the first call will instantiate a `FilterState`, and the second call will modify it.

Creating `teal_slices` with slices with duplicated `id`s is forbidden and will raise an error.


#### 1. Setting the filter state
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(teal.slice)

datasets <- init_filtered_data(
  list(
    iris = list(dataset = iris),
    mtcars = list(dataset = mtcars)
  )
)

set_filter_state(
  datasets = datasets,
  filter = teal_slices(
    teal_slice(dataname = "iris", varname = "Species", selected = "virginica", keep_na = FALSE),
    teal_slice(dataname = "mtcars", id = "4 cyl", title = "4 Cylinders", expr = "cyl == 4"),
    teal_slice(dataname = "mtcars", varname = "mpg", selected = c(20.0, 25.0), keep_na = FALSE, keep_inf = FALSE),
    include_varnames = list(iris = c("Species", "Sepal.Length")),
    exclude_varnames = list(mtcars = "cyl")
  )
)
```

#### 2. Updating filter states. *Works only in the shiny reactive context.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set_filter_state(
  datasets = datasets,
  filter = teal_slices(
    teal_slice(dataname = "mtcars", varname = "mpg", selected = c(22.0, 25.0))
  )
)
```

#### 3. Getting the filter state
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
get_filter_state(datasets)
```

#### 4. Removing filter states
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
remove_filter_state(
  datasets = datasets,
  filter = teal_slices(
    teal_slice(dataname = "iris", varname = "Species")
  )
)
```

#### 5. Clearing the filter state
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
clear_filter_states(datasets)
```

### Controlling settings of the filter panel

In addition to controlling individual filter states through `set_filter_state`, 
one can also manage some general behaviors of the whole filter panel. 
This can be done with arguments of the `teal_slices` function:

1. `include_varnames` defines which columns in the used data sets are allowed to be filtered on. 
In the following example only two columns of `iris` and two columns of `mtcars` will be able to have filters set. 
```{r}
set_filter_state(
  datasets,
  teal_slices(
    include_varnames = list(
      iris = c("Species", "Sepal.Length"),
      mtcard = c("cyl", "mpg")
    )
  )
)
```

2. `exclude_varnames` defines which columns in the used data sets are **not** allowed to be filtered on.
In following example all variables except the four will be available to choose from.
```{r}
set_filter_state(
  datasets,
  teal_slices(
    exclude_varnames = list(
      iris = c("Species", "Sepal.Length"),
      mtcard = c("cyl", "mpg")
    )
  )
)
```

3. `count_type` defines how observations counts displayed in filter cards

| "none" | "all" |
|--------|-------|
| Distribution in unfiltered data | Filtered vs. unfiltered distribution  |
| ![](./images/filter_panel/count_type_none.jpeg){width=300} | ![](./images/filter_panel/count_type_all.jpeg){width=300} |

4. `module_add` determines whether the "Add Filter Variables" module will be displayed 
to allow the user to add new filters.



## Filter panel as a module

All the instructions herein can be utilized to build a shiny app.

```{r}
library(shiny)

# initializing FilteredData
datasets <- init_filtered_data(
  list(
    iris = list(dataset = iris),
    mtcars = list(dataset = mtcars)

# setting initial filters
set_filter_state(
  datasets = datasets,

    teal_slice(dataname = "mtcars", id = "4 cyl", title = "4 Cylinders", expr = "cyl == 4"),
    teal_slice(dataname = "mtcars", varname = "mpg", selected = c(20.0, 25.0), keep_na = FALSE, keep_inf = FALSE),
    include_varnames = list(iris = c("Species", "Sepal.Length")),
    exclude_varnames = list(mtcars = "cyl"),
    count_type = "all",
    module_add = TRUE
  )
)

          verbatimTextOutput("rcode"),
          verbatimTextOutput("filter_state")
        )

      column(

        id = "teal_secondary_col",
        datasets$ui_filter_panel("filter_panel")
      )
    )
  ),
  server = function(input, output, session) {
    # calling filter panel module
    datasets$srv_filter_panel("filter_panel")

    # displaying actual filter states
    output$filter_state <- renderPrint(print(get_filter_state(datasets), trim = FALSE))

    # displaying reproducible filter call
    output$rcode <- renderText(
      paste(
        sapply(c("iris", "mtcars"), datasets$get_call),
        collapse = "\n"
      )
    )

    # programmatic interaction with FilteredData
    observeEvent(input$add_species_filter, {
      set_filter_state(
        datasets,
        teal_slices(
          teal_slice(dataname = "iris", varname = "Species", selected = c("setosa", "versicolor"))
        )
      )
    })

    # programmatic removal of the FilterState
    observeEvent(input$remove_species_filter, {
      remove_filter_state(
        datasets,
        teal_slices(
          teal_slice(dataname = "iris", varname = "Species")
        )
      )
    })
    observeEvent(input$remove_all_filters, clear_filter_states(datasets))
  }
)
if (interactive()) {
  runApp(app)
}
```
